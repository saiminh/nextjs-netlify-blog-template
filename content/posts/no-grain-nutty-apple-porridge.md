 	<li>¼ tsp x nutmeg</li>
 	<li>¼ tsp x ground cloves</li>
 	<li>¼ tsp x vanilla powder</li>
 	<li>½ cup x unsweetened dairy-free milk of choice (I'd suggest coconut if you're going all out on the grain-free thing)</li>

Add the nuts to a food processor or blender with the remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth.

Here’s a warm and wintry spiced porridge made with nuts rather than oats. It’s filling, nutritious and delicious. This version uses apples, which are rich in prebiotics (these stimulate the growth of healthy microflora that populate your large intestine). You could easily swap them for sweet potato, carrot or pumpkin puree though. Banana is also an option, although I’m steering clear of them for the winter in a bid to [eat with the seasons](http://cookingwithnothing.com/post/133342667601/the-real-reason-im-eating-with-the-seasons).
