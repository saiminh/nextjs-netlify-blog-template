ingredients: "<h2 class=\"recipe_component_name\">Low-FODMAP Mee Goreng</h2>
    <p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em>Serves two</em></p>

<ul style=\"font-weight: 400\">
 	<li>2 TBSP x coconut oil</li>
 	<li>2 x organic free-range eggs, lightly beaten</li>
 	<li>100g x haricot vert green beans, trimmed and cut in half on an angle</li>
 	<li>100g x bok choy (leaves and stalks), roughly chopped</li>
 	<li>300g x brown rice noodles, cooked and drained</li>
 	<li>1 ½ tsp x ground coriander</li>
 	<li>1 tsp x ground cumin</li>
 	<li>¼ tsp x white pepper</li>
 	<li>2 x red chillies, finely chopped (use more or less, depending on your heat preference)</li>
 	<li>4 TBSP x tamari</li>
 	<li>50g x mung bean sprouts</li>
 	<li>1 handful x firm lettuce (iceberg or little gem are good), roughly chopped</li>
 	<li>2 x spring onions (green part only*), diced</li>
 	<li>Juice of 1 x lemon</li>
 	<li>Fresh coriander, to garnish</li>
</ul>"
instructions: "<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Place a wok over a high heat and add 1 x TBSP of the coconut oil. Once melted, add the eggs and cook until just set. I use a small frying pan and cook them into a thin omelette. Place to one side. Add the remaining oil and cook the haricot vert for a few minutes.</p>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Add the bok choy and cook until it wilts, then throw in the rice noodles. Spread the noodles in the wok using tongs or chopsticks – you want them to get a lot of heat, almost to fry. Mix gently, cooking the noodles for about two minutes.</p>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now add the spices, chilli, tamari, bean sprouts and a tablespoon of cold water, and toss carefully. Cook for about a minute.</p>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Slice the cooked egg into thick strips and add it back to the pan to heat through.</p>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">When ready to serve, transfer the noodles into bowls and top with shredded lettuce, spring onions and fresh coriander. Squeeze some lemon juice over the top and serve.</p>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em>Note: Tofu is called for in the original recipe and is allowed on the standard low-FODMAP diet. I chose to use eggs instead as I tend to avoid non-fermented sources of soy. Read more about it <a href=\"https://www.bewell.com/blog/the-soy-situation/\">here</a>.</em></p>
*Don't throw away the white spring onion stalks! Sit them in some water on the window sill. The greens will grow back."

As a New Zealander now living in Europe, I miss Malaysian food for both its flavour and price. Granted this was many years ago, but we used to down bowlfuls of Mee Goreng (Malaysian stir-fried noodles) for just over a fiver – no more than a few euro. But knowing what I now know about food, I can admit that those weren’t the healthiest days of my life. And even a healthier version of Mee Goreng still contains FODMAPs such as onions, which can trigger IBS symptoms for some.

So here’s my low-FODMAP makeover, inspired by **[Yotam Ottolenghi’s version](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Flifeandstyle%2F2008%2Fnov%2F01%2Fmee-goreng-yotam-ottolenghi&t=NDkwYmJlZDU2NGVlNzFiNGRlMjFiZDNlMjNkMWNkOGVkNzc2NTY5Zix6VDU0MlBsbw%3D%3D&b=t%3AVOYglxJ9sBHW8BFVroDfxQ&p=http%3A%2F%2Fcookingwithnothing.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F24618164282%2Fmee-goreng-low-fodmap&m=1)**, that’s a lot better for both you and your gut.
