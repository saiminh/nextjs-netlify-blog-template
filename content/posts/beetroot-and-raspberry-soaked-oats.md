It's getting wintry. There's more mood lighting in my food photography and more of a reason to eat vibrant feel-good food. I’ve mentioned before that I like to always include a vegetable in my breakfast. This recipe sneaks one into soaked oats, and the beetroot-raspberry combo is a winner.

Beetroots are still available at this time of year, and I use frozen raspberries here rather than imported fresh ones. Berries are one of those things you should be buying organic, but apparently the frozen ones contain less harmful pesticides since they're not grown for good shelf life. In the summer and autumn, feel free to purchase fresh organic berries instead.

Oats are a prebiotic, meaning they foster the growth of good bacteria in the gut. But like other grains, legumes and nuts, they also contain phytic acid. When entering the digestive tract, this acid binds to certain healthy minerals and renders them indigestible. It also hinders the function of  a number of digestive enzymes. The workaround? Soaking your oats overnight.
