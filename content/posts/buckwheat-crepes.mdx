ingredients: "<h2 class=\"recipe_component_name\">Buckwheat crepes</h2><em>Makes 8-10</em>
<ul>
 	<li>4 x large free-range organic eggs</li>
 	<li>1 cup x unsweetened almond milk (or coconut milk, especially if pairing with Indian-style fillings)</li>
 	<li>Pinch of sea salt</li>
 	<li>2/3 cup x buckwheat flour</li>
 	<li>2 TBSP x coconut oil</li>
</ul>"
instructions: "Whisk eggs with milk and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Sift in the flour and whisk until just combined. Cover the bowl and place in the fridge while you prepare your fillings.

To cook the crepes, heat a 22-cm pan over a med-high heat. Add a tsp of coconut oil and swirl to coat the pan. Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the pan and swirl to evenly cover the base. Cook until the edges of the crepe are crisp (about 1 minute) then flip and cook for a further 30 seconds before transferring to a plate. Keep the crepes warm in the oven while you make the rest."

This recipe is one of those ones that afterwards you ask yourself: _why have I not made this before?!_ I’ve cooked buckwheat pancakes plenty of times, but crepes that you can stuff with savoury fillings? Nope.

And now I’m already dreaming of the gazillion goodies I could fill these bad boys with. My chunky smoked aubergine, grilled pepper and feta spread is a great choice. An Indian-style concoction also comes to mind: tonnes of veggies cooked in spices and coconut. You could also do something super simple like avocado, tomato and feta.

The same crepe recipe can be used for sweet toppings, too. Feel free to add 1/2 teaspoon or so of cinnamon to the batter if you're going down that route. A handful of your favourite berries (or whatever fruit is in season) with a dollop of coconut yoghurt would finish things off nicely.
