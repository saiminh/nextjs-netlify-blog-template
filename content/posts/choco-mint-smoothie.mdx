ingredients: "<h2 class=\"recipe_component_name\">Choco mint smoothie</h2>\"<ul>
 	<li>1 cup x milk substitute of choice*</li>
 	<li>1/8 x avocado**</li>
 	<li>1 x frozen banana</li>
 	<li>Handful x spinach leaves</li>
 	<li>6 x mint leaves</li>
 	<li>A few drops x peppermint extract</li>
 	<li>1/2 tsp x spirulina powder</li>
 	<li>1 TBSP x raw cacao nibs</li>
</ul>"
instructions: "Combine all ingredients except the cacao nibs in a blender and pulse until smooth. Stir the cacao nibs through (and garnish with a few extra if you like).

* those on a low-FODMAP diet are safe with lactose-free, hemp, macadamia, rice, quinoa or almond milk (be sure to check for high-FODMAP additives such as inulin). I usually alternate between almond milk and coconut milk.

** if not on a low-FODMAP diet, feel free to increase this amount. You’ll get a creamier result."

I’ve probably talked about my love of peppermint choc chip ice cream on this blog before, but obviously making a diet-friendly version takes time. This little gem, however, is a breeze to blend up. It’s not quite the same as the real deal, but it’s still damn good.
