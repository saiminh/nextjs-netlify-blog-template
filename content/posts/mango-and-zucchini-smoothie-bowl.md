Subtle enough to hide behind whatever fruit you use and creamier than spinach, zucchini makes a great base for a sneaky veggie smoothie. I’m aware that mangoes don’t grow in my neck of the woods, but sometimes I’ll see big baskets on offer at the markets and nab one that seems on its last legs. According to the [Dutch sustainable fruit and vegetable calendar](https://groentefruit.milieucentraal.nl), mangoes from the Ivory Coast, Mexico and Mali score a B (‘a good choice’) when bought in June. And for good gut health, I’ll only eat mangoes in the warmer months anyway (read why [here](https://cookingwithnothing.com/the-real-reason-im-eating-with-the-seasons/)).

In keeping with the tropical taste of mango, I use coconut yoghurt here, but feel free to substitute for dairy yoghurt your favourite non-dairy alternative. As with all my [sneaky veggie smoothies](https://cookingwithnothing.com/tag/sneaky-veggie-smoothie/), this can be turned into a more drinkable/less spoonable smoothie by using coconut (or any other) milk instead of yoghurt.
