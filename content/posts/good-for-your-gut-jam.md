ingredients: "<h2 class=\"recipe_component_name\">Sugar-free jam</h2>
    <ul>
 	<li>1 cup x strawberries, stalks removed (or another berry of choice)</li>
 	<li>A good splash of water or lemon juice</li>
 	<li>A few drops of liquid stevia</li>
 	<li>2 TBSP x freshly ground linseeds (chia seeds will work too)</li>
</ul>"
instructions: "If you have a small enough saucepan (I use the tall narrow one that comes with my milk frother), you can add the ingredients straight into the pan and blend using a stick blender. A bigger saucepan won't offer enough depth for blending, though. If that's all you have, pre-blend the ingredients before popping them in a saucepan over a medium heat.

Cook the mixture until it starts to bubble up, then lower the heat and whisk until it thickens. This may happen straight away, or it could take a few minutes.

Remove from the heat and leave to cool before serving. Store in the fridge for up to a week."

No, I’m not American, but this morning I had a craving for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Sugary jam isn’t exactly good for your gut, though. In fact, it’s not great for much except an imminent sugar crash.

As it happened, I had a punnet of strawberries in the fridge that had seen better days. They became the base of this sugar-free jammy jam, but other berries would work just as well. The linseeds offer a good dose of essential omega 3 fatty acids.

Serve as a jam, or dollop a spoonful on top of your morning oats.
