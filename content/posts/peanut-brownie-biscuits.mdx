ingredients: "<h2 class=\"recipe_component_name\">Peanut brownie biscuits</h2>
    <em>Makes 18 small biscuits </em>
<ul>
 	<li>2 TBSP x grass-fed gelatin</li>
 	<li>¼ cup x cold water</li>
 	<li>2 cups x almond meal</li>
 	<li>2 TBSP x raw cacao</li>
 	<li>1 TBSP x coconut flour</li>
 	<li>1 tsp x baking soda</li>
 	<li>Pinch of salt</li>
 	<li>100ml x coconut milk</li>
 	<li>1 tsp x pure vanilla extract</li>
 	<li>50g x coconut oil</li>
 	<li>4 TBSP x maple syrup</li>
 	<li>1 cup x roasted unsalted peanuts, shelled (or the equivalent of roughly chopped almonds if you prefer)</li>
 	<li>60g x 85% dark chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
</ul>"
instructions: "Pour the cold water into a small bowl and sprinkle over the gelatin. Stir to combine, making sure to remove any lumps as you go, and let sit for around 5 minutes until it sets.

Sift the almond meal, raw cacao, coconut flour, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Stir to combine.

Heat the coconut milk, vanilla and coconut oil in a small saucepan over a medium heat until the oil dissolves. Remove from the heat and stir in the gelatin until it dissolves, then add the honey and mix to combine.

Pour the coconut-milk/gelatin mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients and gently mix until smooth.

Add the peanuts and dark chocolate and stir through, being careful not to over-mix. Allow the batter to sit for around 10 minutes until it thickens up.

Take heaped tablespoons of the batter and roll into balls. Flatten slightly with a fork and place on a lightly greased baking tray, or a tray with a sheet of baking paper.

Bake for 15 minutes or until golden. Allow to cool completely before serving.

These are best fresh, but can also be stored in the fridge in an airtight container for up to a week."

Maybe it’s the winter creeping in, but I’ve been craving home baking these past few weeks – specifically the super-Kiwi stuff my mum used to whip up from the good old _Edmonds Cookery Book_. I have a copy, and the baking is (unsurprisingly) packed with sugar, so I’m on a mission to tweak a few classics to make them more gut friendly. Here’s the first: peanut brownie biscuits, which could easily become almond brownie biscuits if you prefer.

While this grain-free recipe may not produce perfect replicas of the crunchy-on-the-outside-chewy-on-the-inside cookies you might know and love, they definitely hit the spot. And I’ve sneaked in a dose of grass-fed gelatin, which – among other [health benefits](https://cookingwithnothing.com/chocolate-and-cardamom-gummy-squares/) – can help to repair damaged gut linings. How’s that for a guilt-free treat?
