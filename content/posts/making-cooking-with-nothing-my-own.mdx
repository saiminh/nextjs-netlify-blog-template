I’ve been busy, even though it may not look like it to those who’ve been following Cooking with Nothing lately. It’s been a long time in the making, but I’ve finally ditched the Tumblr blog and launched a new original site. I wanted to make Cooking with Nothing my own, and with the help of the talented [Mr Simon Flöter](https://floter.design/) – design extraordinaire, and not to mention the [poop donor](https://cookingwithnothing.com/who-gives-a-shit/) who gave me my health back – it’s now something I’m proud to share with the world.

It will still be a place to share recipes and to post about the trials and tribulations of living with a gut disorder. I’m also planning to extend the content to include restaurant reviews and interviews with admirable foodie folk.

The Tumblr blog is still viewable [here](http://cookingwithnothing.tumblr.com/). I haven’t transferred all of the recipes to the new site and most likely won’t do so, since my way of eating has adapted over the years. If there are any recipes you miss from the old days, please comment below and I’ll bring them over this way.

I look forward to sharing more Cooking with Nothing with you all!
