We all need to treat ourselves sometimes, and in times of crisis it feels natural to reach for some sweet comfort. Although there’s a whole raft of people proclaiming this period of COVID-19-induced isolation has left them with too much time on their hands, there’s clearly another group facing the opposite scenario. Those are the ones you won’t hear from as often: who has time for social media when your kids are unexpectedly at home 24/7? I may not be a parent myself, but I’m currently in lockdown with my brother, his wife and their two kids. So this one’s for the people out there who haven’t decided to take up making pastry from scratch in these unprecedented times, those who just want something short and sweet that hits the spot. Here are some of my go-tos (and yes, I’m a chocolate fiend):

**My two-ingredient treat** Silky like mousse, [this](https://cookingwithnothing.com/my-two-ingredient-treat/) combination of coconut yoghurt and raw cacao will satisfy chocolate cravings and feed good gut bacteria in the process. Win-win

**Dark chocolate** Go 80% cocoa or above, and limit yourself to just a few pieces

**Warm cacao** My sister-in-law has been making us hot chocolates with ceremonial grade cacao, meaning you can just add hot water and blend to make a super creamy heart-warming drink. Include a drop of your favourite essential oil (peppermint is one of our faves, just make sure it’s an edible-grade oil) to customize the flavour

**Yoghurt, walnuts and honey** Love this combination, even more so if you strain the yoghurt beforehand to make it thicker and creamier. That adds a bit more fuss to what’s supposed to be a low-fuss dish though, so picking a good quality Greek yoghurt is another option. Top with some toasted nuts and a drizzle of raw honey and you’re set

**Quick faux ice creams** \- This one’s only no-fuss if you happen to have some frozen bananas on hand. If not, slice up some pieces and get them freezing for tomorrow. Once frozen, whizz some in a blender with a dollop of nut butter and any other goodies you have on hand for an ice cream-like treat.

\- Blend together a handful of frozen berries with a good dollop of coconut or dairy yoghurt.
