After three months on SCD, the Specific Carbohydrate Diet outlined in _[Breaking the Vicious Cycle](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breakingtheviciouscycle.info%2F&t=YTgzYjI0YjU3MGMwYjViMDM1NzRlZTZhYmFiOTQ2ZDZiOTA0YzZkMCxEdk02YUNVag%3D%3D&b=t%3AVOYglxJ9sBHW8BFVroDfxQ&p=http%3A%2F%2Fcookingwithnothing.com%2Fpost%2F115845147171%2F3-months-scd-and-back-to-low-fodmaps&m=1)_, I called it a day and switched back to low-FODMAPs. Why? Because once things settled down after the so-called two- to three-month flare, my symptoms returned with a vengeance. To be honest, I’d never had such severe issues for such prolonged periods of time as those I experienced over the past three months. And I knew for sure I’d been more stable on low-FODMAPs alone, so that’s what I went back to. Within days I already felt a bit better – gut-wise as well as energy-wise.

One week ago I had a glucose version of the hydrogen breath test to check for SIBO, as the hospital I went to doesn’t do the lactulose one. The issue with these tests is that neither is conclusive. Mine was negative, meaning I either don’t have SIBO, or if I do, it’s not detectable via the glucose test. I’m now waiting for an appointment with the gut specialist at a different hospital and doing my best until then. I’m not saying I’ve given up hope of finding the greater issue behind my symptoms. I keep coming back to the initial [comment](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.katescarlata.com%2F2014%2F09%2F02%2Flow-fodmap-diet-forever-diet%2F&t=NDRkNjUyMDllN2Q4ZGRlZTI3YWVlYjcwMTBmNmI2ODdiMmVkOTMwNSxEdk02YUNVag%3D%3D&b=t%3AVOYglxJ9sBHW8BFVroDfxQ&p=http%3A%2F%2Fcookingwithnothing.com%2Fpost%2F115845147171%2F3-months-scd-and-back-to-low-fodmaps&m=1) that sparked this journey for me: the low-FODMAP diet isn’t a forever diet. But it is a welcome pit stop until I get some answers.
