I like the beetroot-berry combo: two purple foods that taste great together. Plus, adding beetroot sneaks a vegetable into what would otherwise be a fruit-filled smoothie, increasing fibre and nutrition. I cook the beetroot to make it easier to digest (and to help make the smoothie a bit creamier), but feel free to go raw if thatâ€™s your thing. See my [beetroot and raspberry soaked oats](https://cookingwithnothing.com/beetroot-and-raspberry-soaked-oats/) for another spin on the pairing.

Feel like a smoothie bowl instead? Use (coconut) yoghurt instead of milk, then top with your favourite goodies: cacao nibs (unsuitable for the hypoallergenic diet), coconut, puffed quinoa, buckwheat flakes, fresh berries, pomegranate seeds, toasted and chopped almonds . . .
