'The low-FODMAP diet is NOT a FOREVER diet!' This was the title of a [blog post](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.katescarlata.com%2F2014%2F09%2F02%2Flow-fodmap-diet-forever-diet%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dlow-fodmap-diet-forever-diet&t=Mjk1ODRjZmQ2YjI0NDZlNTEzNWIwNzk3ZDIxNjA3NzAzNmY5ODRkMSxnTDlRMm9Sag%3D%3D&b=t%3AVOYglxJ9sBHW8BFVroDfxQ&p=http%3A%2F%2Fcookingwithnothing.com%2Fpost%2F101416119026%2Fmy-new-regime&m=1) that turned up in my inbox from [Kate Scarlata](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.katescarlata.com%2F&t=Mzk1OGM3YTIxZDc5MTJkMGZjNTNiNDUyM2FjZGQyZWRiODE2ODJjNCxnTDlRMm9Sag%3D%3D&b=t%3AVOYglxJ9sBHW8BFVroDfxQ&p=http%3A%2F%2Fcookingwithnothing.com%2Fpost%2F101416119026%2Fmy-new-regime&m=1), an IBS and FODMAP expert. Until that point, I hadn’t really considered how long I’d been on the diet – a few years, eek! – and had kinda accepted the fact that it was part of my daily life.

Then I read the post, and this point really stuck out:

_‘If you failed ALL challenges despite being guided by a FODMAP knowledgeable dietician, consider the possibility of an  overlapping issue such as: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, dumping syndrome, food chemical intolerance (histamine, salicylate), or gluten sensitivity, to name a few.’_

It was the same week I went to a farewell party and met a nutritional therapist, and we naturally got talking about food (and digestive issues). Talk about timing. I mentioned I had used the low-FODMAP diet to manage my symptoms, but she asked me what I was doing to really _heal_ my gut. I drew a blank; I had no idea. After trying so many different diets and treatments, I’d basically let go of the fact that I _could_ heal it.

So finally I got the right stool test I needed to check if there was an overlapping issue. And yes, there was. Mainly the inability to properly digest (a lack of natural digestive enzymes), bacterial imbalance and a pH that was too acidic. I called up the nutritional therapist and we’re now working on the healing process.

I’m also training to be a yoga teacher over the next wee while, so that – and my focus on healing – will mean fewer recipes, but I’ll do my best! I’ll also post links to yummy low-FODMAP recipes I find, as I’m still working with the basic guidelines of the diet for now.

If you’re in a similar situation to me then I urge you to read Kate’s post. It might just change your life.
