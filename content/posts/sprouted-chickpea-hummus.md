ingredients: "<h2 class=\"recipe_component_name\">Sprouted chickpea hummus</h2>
    <ul>
 	<li>1 1/2 cups x sprouted chickpeas (sprout around 1/2 cups x dried chickpeas to get this amount)</li>
 	<li>1/4 cup x tahini (I prefer white for this recipe)</li>
 	<li>juice and zest of a lemon</li>
 	<li>1 tsp x ground cumin</li>
 	<li>2 x garlic cloves, crushed (<a href=\"https://cookingwithnothing.com/fermented-garlic/\">fermented</a>, if possible)</li>
 	<li>a good pinch of sea salt</li>
 	<li>olive oil, enough to arrive at your desired texture</li>
 	<li>za'atar or <a href=\"https://cookingwithnothing.com/beetroot-and-parsnip-soup-with-dukkah/\">dukkah</a> to serve (optional, check ingredients if following a Hypoallergenic Diet)</li>
</ul>"
instructions: "Rinse the sprouts and pat dry (or cook, drain and cool, if not eating raw).

Add all ingredients except the olive oil and dukkah or za'atar to a food processor and pulse to combine. Use a spatula to scrape the mixture back down from the sides.

Blitz again, drizzling in olive oil while you blend until you arrive at your preferred texture. Note that if using raw sprouts, the texture might not be as creamy as traditional hummus.

Sprinkle with dukkah or za'atar and drizzle with a little extra olive oil if you like. Serve with vegetable sticks (lightly steamed if you want to give your digestive system an extra helping hand), or on some good quality sourdough bread (if you're not gluten-free) or rice cakes."

Once you've [sprouted some chickpeas](https://cookingwithnothing.com/sprouts/), you can quickly whip up this easier-to-digest hummus. As mentioned in that post, the sprouting process ‘increases the cooling attributes . . . which can weaken digestion in those with low “digestive fire”. If someone tends toward loose stools, sprouts must be eaten sparingly, or cooked before consuming. Sound like you? Then simply steam the sprouted chickpeas until tender and allow to cool before use.
